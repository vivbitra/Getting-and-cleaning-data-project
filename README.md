Vivek Vardhan Bitra


This repository consists of project submission for getting and cleaning data

###Overview
This project deals with getting data, manipulating, operating on it to create a tidy data set for subsequent analysis

### Modifications for the script
The working directory command present in the run_analysis.R should be changed before going forward with the data analysis

##Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

I used signif function to roundoff the digits including sign to 5, Hence the values in tidydata.txt file may change to their approx round off number.
